# Ubuntu 20.04 Setup Scripts!

Hello, this is a repository of scripts I use to automate my life when I inevitably mess up my personal computer. Running helper.sh installs all of the good stuff that I use for my personal development stuff.

## My motivation for this. 
I tend to break my Development environments a lot. So these scripts are intended to be the easiest way for me to keep breaking things and be efficient about it.

## Usage

```bash
bash helper.sh
```
Ideally this script will only install the things that are not installed.
